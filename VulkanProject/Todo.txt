do UI rendering before world rendering and write depthbuffer to save resources

maybe convert MemoryLocation to use startOffset and size (performance)

optimize vertex size

make 2d vertices

Fix runtime library to use /MD and not /MDd.

Vulkan types are created with new

check if can bind multiple buffers with vkCmdBindVertexBuffers
